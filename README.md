# :robot: SNCF Sucks

A small bot to demonstrate how the french railway system sucks.

> :warning: You might find in the source code my API key for the SNCF API, please use your own as it is limited. (creating one is fairly easy !)

## Why ?

I travel a lot, be it for work or pleasure, and often find my day ruined by the terrible traveling experience proposed by the SNCF (the french railway company).  
I wasn't sure the SNCF was this terrible until I found myself having troubles with AirFrance (the french airways company).

To draw a small yet demonstrative comparison :
| | SNCF | AirFrance |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Scenario | I would say that at least 1 in 3 of the trains I took to travel was delay. | Once delayed in the 7 flights I had with the company |
| Ticket price | 25e to 86e with a 75% discount lucky me. | 106e for the jurney in question. (one-way ticket) |
| Delay | This goes from insignificant (5 minutes) to pretty long (1 to 3 hours) and even goes as far as requiring to pay for a taxi to get home because it was to late to catch another train. | 4 hours (With a HOP! flight the lowcost company of AirFrance) |
| Compensation | Should have been 30% of the price of the ticket but nothing, not even an answer to my complain. No compensation nor help regarding the fees engaged because of the delay. | Answered in 22 hours, 250e wired to my account (or I could have taken a 350e voucher). |
| Side notes | Employees don't care, often served with an attitude. Poor service. | Kind human beings, helpful and caring. |

You see where I am going with this ?

## The ultimate goal ?

| Idea | Status | Info |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Compute the total delay on a 24 hour basis | :green_circle: | lib/sncf.py |
| Get some interesting statistics | :green_circle: | lib/comparer.py |
| Compare the stats with some other company (AirFrance) | :yellow_circle: | Questioning data integrity (Only 700 flights a day ?!) |
| Create a website that displays this data nicely | :hourglass_flowing_sand: | Kinda need to learn CSS. |
| Make the SNCF service great | :x: | |
