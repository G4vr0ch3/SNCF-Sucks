# :robot: SNCF Sucks

A small bot to demonstrate how the french railway system sucks.

> :warning: You might find in the source code my API key for the SNCF API, please use your own as it is limited. (creating one is fairly easy !)

## Why ?

I travel a lot, be it for work or pleasure, and often find my day ruined by the terrible traveling experience proposed by the SNCF (the french railway company).  
I wasn't sure the SNCF was this terrible until I found myself having troubles with AirFrance (the french airways company).

To draw a small yet demonstrative comparison :
| | SNCF | AirFrance |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Scenario | I would say that at least 1 in 3 of the trains I took to travel was delay. | Once delayed in the 7 flights I had with the company |
| Ticket price | 25e to 86e with a 75% discount lucky me. | 106e for the jurney in question. (one-way ticket) |
| Delay | This goes from insignificant (5 minutes) to pretty long (1 to 3 hours) and even goes as far as requiring to pay for a taxi to get home because it was to late to catch another train. | 4 hours (With a HOP! flight the lowcost company of AirFrance) |
| Compensation | Should have been 30% of the price of the ticket but nothing, not even an answer to my complain. No compensation nor help regarding the fees engaged because of the delay. | Answered in 22 hours, 250e wired to my account within 3 business days (or I could have taken a 350e voucher). |
| Side notes | When I missed my connection because of the delay, an employee with an attitude explained to me how I was going to have to wait for 4 more hours if I wanted to be seated or I could take my chances with the next train in an hour with no guarantee. When the train was so late we could not go back home with public transportation because it was late at night, the two employees kicked us out of the train station 2 minutes after the train arrived because they where closing. In every case, no employee cares. | Smiling and concerned personnel, offering drinks and snacks, going through every person with a missed connection to propose a solution. Support at the airport at midnight. Just great people. |

You see where I am going with this ?

## The ultimate goal ?

| Idea | Status |
| :-: | :-: |
| Compute the total delay on a 24 hour basis | :green_circle: |
| Get some interesting statistics | :yellow_circle: |
| Compare the stats with some other company (AirFrance) | :hourglass_flowing_sand: |
| Create a website that displays this data nicely | :hourglass_flowing_sand: |
| Make the SNCF service great | :x: |
